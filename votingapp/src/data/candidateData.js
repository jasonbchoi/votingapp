        blurb: 'Biden is the former Vice President under the Obama Administration. He is currently running  on the legacy of the eight years he served alongside President Barack Obama and has proposed advancing that legacy on key issues like health care and the climate crisis. When he formally announced his entry into the 2020 presidential race, Joe Biden declared that he stood for two things - workers who "built this country", and values that can bridge its divisions. Some of the issues his platform advocates for include $15 minimum hourly wage, expansion of Obamacare subsidies, and free college for families making under $125,000 a year.',
